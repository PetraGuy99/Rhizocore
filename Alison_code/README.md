# Code written for Rhizocore's Summer 2024 tree measuring trips 

All of this code is written pre-Petra joining and new measurement trips plus rcd measurements being added.
Therefore this code serves as a document of Alison's work, but it should not be used for any data analysis.
Addtionally to use this code you'd likely need to edit it heavliy as the style of our databases have changed.
